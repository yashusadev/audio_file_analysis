# audio_file_analysis
This is an audio processing project that loads an audio file, extracts features like MFCCs, and visualizes the waveform.

This project is simple and demostrates that I know:
1. How to load and visualize an audio file
2. How to extract features (MFCCs)
3. How to save features in a structured format (CSV)

MFCCs are features extracted from audio signals that represent the power spectrum in a way that mimics human hearing, emphasizing frequencies that humans are more sensitive to. They are commonly used for speech and voice recognition tasks, as they efficiently capture important acoustic features of sound.
